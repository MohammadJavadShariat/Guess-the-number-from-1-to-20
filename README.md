# Guess-the-number-from-1-to-20
Hello!
In this program, the computer stores a number between 0 and 20, and then you are asked which number is stored in the computer.
You enter a number, and if it is the same number, the game ends, but if it is bigger, the computer says lower and asks the question again, and if it is smaller, the computer says higher and asks the question again.
This program has been fixed with try and except, and if you enter text, it gives an error message and asks again.
If you want to exit it, just enter the word Exit.
I hope you like this program.
